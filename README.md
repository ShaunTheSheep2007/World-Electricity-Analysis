    1. Stated with creating the new database and importing all the flat files into the database.
    
    2. Did a bit of cleaning and changed the datatypes accordingly.
    
    3. Took help of different SQL clauses like group by, order by, having etc in order to manupalate the data and get the insights out.
    
    4. Also used some of the aggregate functions like sum, average , count along with case when statement and windows function to analysis the data.
    
    5. Took help of CTEs for writing the some of the complex queries for bucketing.
    
    6. Exported all the tables from SQL to excel and created required pivot tables to gain some insights.
    
    7. Created the pivot charts from the table for better understanding of the data.
    
    8. Also Designed a interactive dashboard from the charts for better visualisation.

   1. Most of the reviews and ratings from the customers buying different properties were positive which shows that the customers are satisfied with the kind of property the company is offering.
   
   2. March-April and December is peak season for the company and around June month is the off peak season.
   
   3. Properties in Vancouver is way more costlier than that of properties in Toronto.
